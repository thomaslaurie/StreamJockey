and error states in addition to the display component; because the async display getter function has to be defined inside the wrapper, that means that for every async component i need to write a new extended wrapper and display component, in addition to possible custom loading and error components.\r\n\t\t// I want to simply write the single async component extending from the BaseLoader and optional loading and error components extending from BaseLoading and BaseError, this can't happen because vue's dynamic components can only switch components and not templates (they cant switch the component itself for another).\r\n\t\t// I also dont want to have to pass every custom property down from the loader to the display component\r\n\t\t// Therefore a custom switch for templates is needed: vue's v-if directive works for this, however this would have to be repeated for every extended component.\r\n\t\t// So I made a template builder function that allows the writing of the main display template, and then optional loading or error components all in one component.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t//TODO the problem now is that to be able to use this method in the components extending from base-loading, ill need to import the sj module to be able to call it, (what if the base imports then provides a method to render?)\r\n\r\n\t\t//L this is what i need: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50800945/vue-wrap-another-component-passing-props-and-events\r\n\t\t//L https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-attrs, //! defined props aren't included in $attrs, but because they are 'known' they can just as easily be passed down\r\n\t\t//L https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-listeners\r\n\t\t//L https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#inheritAttrs //! inheritAttrs = false will prevent non-prop attributes from being applied to the root element of the template (incase some other desired functionality is desired, like modifying them in the wrapper before they are re-attached), I dont think this is needed for this wrapper\r\n\t\t//! all these don't affect the class and style attributes\r\n\t\t//! v-bind= and v-on= (these don't have arguments) are used specifically for the $attr, and $listeners case - \"When used without an argument, can be used to bind an object containing attribute name-value pairs.\"\r\n\t\t//L they're called 'transparent components', this might have some advanced info TODO: https://zendev.com/2018/05/31/transparent-wrapper-components-in-vue.html\r\n\t\t// as far as I understand that article, it details pulling props & listeners out of the list of ones passed to child components if there actually are some specific props needed for the wrapper component (and not needed in the child components) - 'semi-transparency'\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t//TODO while this does solve passing stuff to child, it still requires making both the loader and the child\r\n\t\t// // i think the solution is to write a generic loader component, then have the display component have the data loading function, then use events up to the parent to communicate switching (which will also let the error, and loading components to communicate a retry)\r\n\r\n\t\t//L communication: https://alligator.io/vuejs/component-communication/\r\n\t\t//L best way to manage state//?: https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#model\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t// display updates display value and switches to display comp\r\n\t\t// loading switches to loading comp\r\n\t\t// error updates error value and switches to error comp\r\n\r\n\t\t//TODO issue: if the display component loads the data, it needs to be initially loaded\r\n\r\n\t\t//TODO other issue: even if this all works, either different loaders will have to be created for each display component (re-introducing the two component issue) or there will have to be some slot system where the base-loader is referenced each time with the specific display, loader, and error components slotted in - which is also very verbose\r\n\t\t// // the only reason this sj.dynamicTemplate() function was created was to avoid having to repeat template markup (the v-if directives, or dynamic component stuff) for each descendant of the base-loader\r\n\r\n\t\t//? what is the issue with having a component that manages it's own display state? right... it was the repeated markup needed\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t// I want to: easily write an async component that loads its own data and displays other components when its loading or errored, and I want to write the display markup in itself without having to repeat wrapper markup \r\n\t\t// - but I cant avoid wrapper markup with out a dynamic template function (no) or a wrapper component (maybe)\r\n\t\t// - but then I have to figure out a way to use a wrapper component without making specific wrapper components, this requires the verbose markup (maybe)\r\n\t\t// like:\r\n\t\t// <loader>\r\n\t\t// \t<display component>\r\n\t\t// </loader>\r\n\r\n\t\t// display component can be the one to specify custom loader/error components because they will always be coupled to it\r\n\t\t// these display components will (probably) always have to be coupled to the loader wrapper, but it saves having to write a custom loader for each one (and might actually allow a static version of the display component), actually no, is it better to write the wrapper template in the display components or every time when they are used?\r\n\r\n\t\t// >>> so far the best idea seems to be use a wrapper that has slots, where custom display, loading, and error components can be passed into the slots\r\n\t\t//! using slots also completely avoids the property passing issue because the slot components are rendered in the parent's context\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t// now, fall back is to use dynamic components and events - though this requires two components per,\r\n\r\n\t\t// other idea is to have the child in a slot emit a parent's event and listen to parent's event\r\n\r\n\t\t// ^ this is what i did, and it was all and great until i got to the pages where I used the loaders without their display components - all wrapped up in to one component (they load their own data) this actually was really good but required no wrappers (or multiple layers if using wrappers) and the ability to nest this dynamic data, I feel like ive come full circle and the sj.dynamicTemplate() is the best option again\r\n\r\n\t\t// however, I think there is another way - the main reason I used sj.dynamicTemplate() was to avoid repeating markup in the display template (if a component was to manage its own display state, each would have to repeat a conditional wrapper), what if the async-switch component was this conditional wrapper and the main display markup is filled into the default slot? (it minimizes this markup into one element, which is good because there needs to be a single root element anyways), the main hurdle is passing the custom components to it and switching to them\r\n\r\n\t\tsj.dynamicTemplate = function (display, loading, error) {\r\n\t\t\t//C use declared components if custom template is not defined, //!

then using that to translate timestamps to local time?\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n//  ██████╗ ███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███╗   ██╗██████╗ ███████╗███╗   ██╗ ██████╗██╗███████╗███████╗\r\n//  ██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝████╗  ██║██╔══██╗██╔════╝████╗  ██║██╔════╝██║██╔════╝██╔════╝\r\n//  ██║  ██║█████╗  ██████╔╝█████╗  ██╔██╗ ██║██║  ██║█████╗  ██╔██╗ ██║██║     ██║█████╗  ███████╗\r\n//  ██║  ██║██╔══╝  ██╔═══╝ ██╔══╝  ██║╚██╗██║██║  ██║██╔══╝  ██║╚██╗██║██║     ██║██╔══╝  ╚════██║\r\n//  ██████╔╝███████╗██║     ███████╗██║ ╚████║██████╔╝███████╗██║ ╚████║╚██████╗██║███████╗███████║\r\n//  ╚═════╝ ╚══════╝╚═╝     ╚══════╝╚═╝  ╚═══╝╚═════╝ ╚══════╝╚═╝  ╚═══╝ ╚═════╝╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝\r\n\r\n// BUILT-IN\r\n\r\n// INTERNAL\r\nimport { \r\n\tclamp, \r\n\tcapitalizeFirstCharacter,\r\n\tescapeRegExp,\r\n\tpick,\r\n\tasyncMap,\r\n\twait,\r\n\tDeferred,\r\n\tencodeList,\r\n\tone,\r\n\tany,\r\n\trepeat,\r\n\trules,\r\n} from './utility/index.js';\r\nimport {\r\n\trunHTMLScript\r\n} from './browser-utility/index.js';\r\nimport sj from './global.js';\r\nimport Source from './source.client.js';\r\nimport Playback from './playback.js';\r\n\r\n// EXTERNAL\r\nimport moment from 'moment';\r\nimport he from 'he';\r\n\r\n//import './vendor/spotify-player.js'; //! creates window.onSpotifyWebPlaybackSDKReady and window.Spotify, this is supposed to be imported dynamically from https://sdk.scdn.co/spotify-player.js, it may change without notice, wont work here because onSpotifyWebPlaybackSDKReady is undefined\r\n//import SpotifyWebApi from './vendor/spotify-web-api.js'; //L api endpoint wrapper: https://github.com/jmperez/spotify-web-api-js\r\n\r\n\r\n//  ██╗███╗   ██╗██╗████████╗\r\n//  ██║████╗  ██║██║╚══██╔══╝\r\n//  ██║██╔██╗ ██║██║   ██║   \r\n//  ██║██║╚██╗██║██║   ██║   \r\n//  ██║██║ ╚████║██║   ██║   \r\n//  ╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═══╝╚═╝   ╚═╝   \r\n\r\n//C attach external libraries to sj so that they can be used where ever sj is imported\r\nsj.moment = moment;\r\nsj.he = he;\r\nsj.appName = 'StreamJockey';\r\n\r\n\r\n//  ██╗   ██╗████████╗██╗██╗     ██╗████████╗██╗   ██╗\r\n//  ██║   ██║╚══██╔══╝██║██║     ██║╚══██╔══╝╚██╗ ██╔╝\r\n//  ██║   ██║   ██║   ██║██║     ██║   ██║    ╚████╔╝ \r\n//  ██║   ██║   ██║   ██║██║     ██║   ██║     ╚██╔╝  \r\n//  ╚██████╔╝   ██║   ██║███████╗██║   ██║      ██║   \r\n//   ╚═════╝    ╚═╝   ╚═╝╚══════╝╚═╝   ╚═╝      ╚═╝   \r\n\r\nsj.serverLog = async function (message) { //TODO Unused\r\n\treturn await sj.request('POST', `${sj.API_URL}/log`, {message});\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\n//   ██████╗██╗      █████╗ ███████╗███████╗\r\n//  ██╔════╝██║     ██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝\r\n//  ██║     ██║     ███████║███████╗███████╗\r\n//  ██║     ██║     ██╔══██║╚════██║╚════██║\r\n//  ╚██████╗███████╗██║  ██║███████║███████║\r\n//   ╚═════╝╚══════╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝\r\n\r\n// ENTITY CRUD METHODS\r\nsj.Entity.augmentClass({\r\n\tprototypeProperties: parent => ({\r\n\t\tasync add() {\r\n\t\t\treturn await this.constructor.add(this);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tasync get() {\r\n\t\t\treturn await this.constructor.get(this);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tasync edit() { //! instance.edit() doesn't take any arguments, and therefore isn't very useful unless the instance itself is edited\r\n\t\t\treturn await this.constructor.edit(this);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tasync remove() {\r\n\t\t\treturn await this.constructor.remove(this);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t}),\r\n\tstaticProperties: parent => ({\r\n\t\tasync add(query) {\r\n\t\t\treturn await sj.request(\r\n\t\t\t\t'POST', \r\n\t\t\t\t`${sj.API_URL}/${this.table}`, \r\n\t\t\t\tany(query).map((q) => pick(q, this.filters.addIn))\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tasync get(query) {\r\n\t\t\treturn await sj.request(\r\n\t\t\t\t'GET', \r\n\t\t\t\t`${sj.API_URL}/${this.table}?${encodeList(any(query).map((q) => pick(q, this.filters.getIn)))}`\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tasync edit(query) {\r\n\t\t\treturn await sj.request(\r\n\t\t\t\t'PATCH', \r\n\t\t\t\t`${sj.API_URL}/${this.table}`, \r\n\t\t\t\tany(query).map((q) => pick(q, this.filters.editIn))\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tasync remove(query) {\r\n\t\t\treturn await sj.request(\r\n\t\t\t\t'DELETE', \r\n\t\t\t\t`${sj.API_URL}/${this.table}`, \r\n\t\t\t\tany(query).map((q) => pick(q,  this.filters.removeIn))\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t}),\r\n});\r\n\r\n// ACTION\r\n//R commands are separate from the playback module commands because they are supposed to be instanced, queued packets of trigger functionality and frozen state\r\n\r\n//G sj.Commands have their own playback state properties so that they can be queued and then collapsed/annihilated if redundant based on these properties\r\n//G they trigger basic playback functions from all the sources while ensuring these playbacks don't collide (ie. play at the same time)\r\n//G tightly integrated with VueX\r\n//TODO consider a stop command?

This would prompt anything using that object to refresh.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tMaybe a store of 'watched' objects, when a GET request is called it adds the item to the list and the component itself to the item's watchers list. The component then uses this item in the object's store and any updates are propagated. When the component is destroyed the watcher is removed. when the last watcher is removed the item is removed. when an item is deleted the parent item (a playlist or something) will also have to watch it and update somehow. If its just the single item the component refreshes as normal and displays a not found error.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tOr just find an existing library that does this.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tThe entire database must not be synced, it must just be the data that is currently used by components.

Would a permission check need to be implemented?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tFor each item in the notification queue, sort through open rooms and see if they match the item, if they do, send an event to every socket in the room.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tTo match multiple queries, the socket subscription must parse the multiQuery and split it into single queries, to do direct string matching - do this client side.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tSocket and http methods must go through the same validator on the server side\r\n\r\n\t\t\tHow do I prevent events being broadcast to clients for private entities (ie clients that don't have permission to view them), this works as it is but it will trigger the client to update whenever something that matches updates server-side, but that is private so the client receives no new information. Maybe consider putting permissions as part of the database query so it also applies to the rooms?\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tPROCEDURES\r\n\t\t\tserver-side database changes:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t--> any user changes the database\r\n\t\t\t\tadds an entity\r\n\t\t\t\tedits an entity\r\n\t\t\t\tremoves an entity\r\n\t\t\t\tget can be ignored\r\n\t\t\tthe function executes as normal, but also dispatches (without awaiting) the event to [somewhere]\r\n\t\t\t\tthis event includes the entity with all of its (query-able) properties (not just id, because get may query by any property)\r\n\t\t\t\tadd \t- dispatches the entity after the change\r\n\t\t\t\tremove \t- dispatches the entity before the change\r\n\t\t\t\tedit \t- dispatches both the entity before and after the change\r\n\t\t\tthis entity is sent to [where ever query subscriptions are stored] where its compared against each query\r\n\t\t\t\ttry to compare in reverse order of frequency of properties, so that comparisons will short circuit as fast as possible\r\n\t\t\t\tuse a timeout for each query that is checked against the timestamp of the database change, remove subscription if exceeding (maybe like a day or something?)\r\n\t\t\t\t//? more things in here (property filter, permission check, )\r\n\t\t\t<-- if it matches, send a socket event to the connected client that the query has updated\r\n\t\t\t\t//? or could just send the new data directly (makes validation + permissions a bit harder)\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tserver-side subscription:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t--> socket event received\r\n\t\t\t\tincludes a table property and the query entity\r\n\t\t\tquery is validated, modified\r\n\t\t\tquery is also stored along with the user id (permissions) and socket id in [some query store], also with a timestamp\r\n\t\t\t\tsomehow also calculate the needed properties (ie don't return password)\r\n\t\t\t\t//R it doesn't matter too much that the queries are grouped - because users won't often be using the same queries anyways\r\n\t\t\t<-- query is transformed into a string query, and returned\r\n\r\n\t\t\t--> socket event received to unsubscribe from a query with query string\r\n\t\t\t<-- find the query string in the store, validate user id & socket id, and delete it, return success\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tclient-side subscription:\r\n\t\t\t\tmake a module that offers spreads for VueX\r\n\r\n\t\t\t-> component calls VueX to subscribe to a query\r\n\t\t\t<-- query is sent to server via socket to subscribe\r\n\t\t\t--> validated query gets returned from socket\r\n\t\t\tsetup query mirror in VueX\r\n\t\t\tsend get request for initial data\r\n\t\t\tgive the query mirror the data\r\n\t\t\t<- return the reference to the query mirror data\r\n\r\n\t\t\t--> socket receives an event that a query has updated\r\n\t\t\t<-- trigger a new get request for the query identified by the table, & query\r\n\t\t\t--> receive new data\r\n\t\t\tupdate\r\n\r\n\t\t\t-> component calls VueX to unsubscribe from a query (on destroy, or query change)\r\n\t\t\t<-- send a socket message to unsubscribe\r\n\t\t\t--> receive success\r\n\t\t\tremove the query mirror\r\n\t\t\t<- return success\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tSUBSCRIBE - REST vs SOCKET\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tTwo approaches: use a rest request to subscribe and start the socket process, or using a socket request to subscribe and fetch via rest\r\n\t\t\tRest doesn't make as much sense as no method matches exactly what is being done (need to add a subscriber by sending a query and a socket id)\r\n\t\t\tMaybe use a subscribe request, which returns the initial query results, then updates via the socket - completely bypassing any get request\r\n\t\t\tOr keep rest requests for transmitting data, just use the socket to transmit changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tQUERY ENCODING\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI initially thought that encoding a query object as a string and using it as the subscription key would increase performance by decreasing lookup time, however, I'm thinking now that it won't as on the client-side, there won't be very many subscriptions. on the server side, this can't be done because in order to notify a change, these queries need to be subset matched which would require a loop of all subscriptions & subsequent decoding of query stings anyways. just having a list of objects with a query property makes the structure consistent across client and server and shouldn't have too big of a performance cost\r\n\r\n\tNEW\r\n\t\twhat do I want?\r\n\t\r\n\t\tI want the subscription system to be simpler and more clear to understand\r\n\t\t\tthat involves either joining EntitySubscription and QuerySubscription classes, or separating them more\r\n\t\t\t\tmaybe have all subscriptions have a main QuerySubscription that then must refer to any number of 'EntityCache's\r\n\t\tI want to be able to attach subscribe and unsubscribe methods to sj.Entities\r\n\t\t\tthis involves being able to reference the vue store from these entities\r\n\t\t\t\tthese can simply be augmented in this module\r\n\t\tI want to be able to have events/callbacks on subscriptions for when a query has: something added to it, one of its items edited, or something removed from it (ie CRUD without retrieve)\r\n\t\t\tthis involves having each subscriber have its own set of callbacks, which means each subscriber has its own subscriber/subscription object\r\n\r\n\t\tright now as it works\r\n\t\t\ta query can be a QuerySubscription or an EntitySubscription depending on if it is targeting a single entity\r\n\t\t\tboth trigger a get command to refresh their data when notified\r\n\t\t\tEntitySubscriptions (via normal subscriber) update themselves, QuerySubscriptions update their EntitySubscriptions (via QuerySubscription subscriber)\r\n\t\t\tall can have multiple subscribers so that events/lookup/etc. isn't repeated when the same query is subscribed to\r\n\r\n\t\tmaybe:\r\n\t\t\thave a query list\r\n\t\t\t\twhich contains queries that have a list of subscribers\r\n\t\t\t\tand a list of references to entities in the entity cache list\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis list can contain any amount of references \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t//! remember to not just do a direct reference, because if the entity is deleted from the cache, but still referenced in this list - it wont be removed, instead use a reactive getter\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis object also has a reactive getter that determines if it is for a single entity or not - though why would this be needed if the entire system is made the same? - it seemed like there was only a separation to served as an inferred property\r\n\t\t\tand an entity cache list\r\n\t\t\t\twhich contains single entities\r\n\t\t\t\twhich also have a list of queries that include this\r\n\t\t\t\t\twhen it no longer matches any queries (ie the old, no subscribers situation) it gets removed\r\n\t\t\t\tentities are required to have a list of their subscribers/subscriptions so that when one is removed, it knows whether or not to delete the whole thing\r\n\r\n\t\twould end up looking like:\r\n\r\n\t\tqueries: { (map)\r\n\t\t\tquery: {\r\n\t\t\t\tsubscriptions: [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonSubscribe:
