Updating parent components, unrelated components, etc. is a nightmare. This is what I'm using VueX is for anyways.\r\n\t\t\t//L https://forum.vuejs.org/t/vuejs-vuex-data-synchronization-with-server-backend/16340/2\r\n\r\n\t\t\tMaybe a global event bus that calls the object type (user, playlist, track, etc) and its id when updated. This would prompt anything using that object to refresh.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tMaybe a store of 'watched' objects, when a GET request is called it adds the item to the list and the component itself to the item's watchers list. The component then uses this item in the object's store and any updates are propagated. When the component is destroyed the watcher is removed. when the last watcher is removed the item is removed. when an item is deleted the parent item (a playlist or something) will also have to watch it and update somehow. If its just the single item the component refreshes as normal and displays a not found error.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tOr just find an existing library that does this.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tThe entire database must not be synced, it must just be the data that is currently used by components. Anything that is destroyed and recreated will update when it fetches its data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tCLIENT-SIDE LIVE DATA\r\n\r\n\t\t\tIf an item in a list is refreshed and manually retrieves its own unique query (query only by id), it will add its own query in the mirrored database, if the parent list updates, then it switches back reactively based on p-content (the switch will have to include a destroy for the individual query), but this creates duplicate data and wont this mess up other foreign components representing the same data?\r\n\r\n\t\t\tWhat if any queries with multiple results just have references to single queries?\r\n\r\n\t\t\tThe key should be the query itself.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tEncoding keys into a string could mess up types by converting them all into strings, however this shouldn't be an issue as each column in the database only ever has one type.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tHow will the mirrored database interact with non-async components, those that have been passed data without querying it via p-content? maybe still give it a reference but put it in a different list than 'watchers'?\r\n\r\n\t\t\tMaybe have the table as another parameter in the encoded query? A good reason not to is that table is a property that all entities will have, so making it part of the data structure will make searches faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tsomeGetMethod = () {\r\n\t\t\t\tSend http get method with subscribe parameter set to context.state.socket.id.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOr this could also be sent as a second request through the socket.

But even then wont this just call updates on items the subscriber doesn't even have access to? Would a permission check need to be implemented?\r\n\r\n\t\t\tFor each item in the notification queue, sort through open rooms and see if they match the item, if they do, send an event to every socket in the room.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tTo match multiple queries, the socket subscription must parse the multiQuery and split it into single queries, to do direct string matching - do this client side.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tSocket and http methods must go through the same validator on the server side\r\n\r\n\t\t\tHow do I prevent events being broadcast to clients for private entities (ie clients that don't have permission to view them), this works as it is but it will trigger the client to update whenever something that matches updates server-side, but that is private so the client receives no new information.
