Updating parent components, unrelated components, etc. is a nightmare. This is what I'm using VueX is for anyways.\r\n\t\t\t//L https://forum.vuejs.org/t/vuejs-vuex-data-synchronization-with-server-backend/16340/2\r\n\r\n\t\t\tMaybe a global event bus that calls the object type (user, playlist, track, etc) and its id when updated. This would prompt anything using that object to refresh.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tMaybe a store of 'watched' objects, when a GET request is called it adds the item to the list and the component itself to the item's watchers list. The component then uses this item in the object's store and any updates are propagated. When the component is destroyed the watcher is removed. when the last watcher is removed the item is removed. when an item is deleted the parent item (a playlist or something) will also have to watch it and update somehow. If its just the single item the component refreshes as normal and displays a not found error.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tOr just find an existing library that does this.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tThe entire database must not be synced, it must just be the data that is currently used by components. Anything that is destroyed and recreated will update when it fetches its data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tCLIENT-SIDE LIVE DATA\r\n\r\n\t\t\tIf an item in a list is refreshed and manually retrieves its own unique query (query only by id), it will add its own query in the mirrored database, if the parent list updates, then it switches back reactively based on p-content (the switch will have to include a destroy for the individual query), but this creates duplicate data and wont this mess up other foreign components representing the same data?\r\n\r\n\t\t\tWhat if any queries with multiple results just have references to single queries?\r\n\r\n\t\t\tThe key should be the query itself.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tEncoding keys into a string could mess up types by converting them all into strings, however this shouldn't be an issue as each column in the database only ever has one type.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tHow will the mirrored database interact with non-async components, those that have been passed data without querying it via p-content? maybe still give it a reference but put it in a different list than 'watchers'?\r\n\r\n\t\t\tMaybe have the table as another parameter in the encoded query? A good reason not to is that table is a property that all entities will have, so making it part of the data structure will make searches faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tsomeGetMethod = () {\r\n\t\t\t\tSend http get method with subscribe parameter set to context.state.socket.id.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOr this could also be sent as a second request through the socket. Because it can run through the same validation and therefore should be exactly the same.\r\n\t\t\t\tReceive the data.

completely bypassing any get request\r\n\t\t\tOr keep rest requests for transmitting data, just use the socket to transmit changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tQUERY ENCODING\r\n\t\t\tI initially thought that encoding a query object as a string and using it as the subscription key would increase performance by decreasing lookup time, however, I'm thinking now that it won't as on the client-side, there won't be very many subscriptions. on the server side, this can't be done because in order to notify a change, these queries need to be subset matched which would require a loop of all subscriptions & subsequent decoding of query stings anyways. just having a list of objects with a query property makes the structure consistent across client and server and shouldn't have too big of a performance cost\r\n\r\n\tNEW\r\n\t\twhat do I want?\r\n\r\n\t\tI want the subscription system to be simpler and more clear to understand\r\n\t\t\tthat involves either joining EntitySubscription and QuerySubscription classes, or separating them more\r\n\t\t\t\tmaybe have all subscriptions have a main QuerySubscription that then must refer to any number of 'EntityCache's\r\n\t\tI want to be able to attach subscribe and unsubscribe methods to sj.Entities\r\n\t\t\tthis involves being able to reference the vue store from these entities\r\n\t\t\t\tthese can simply be augmented in this module\r\n\t\tI want to be able to have events/callbacks on subscriptions for when a query has: something added to it, one of its items edited, or something removed from it (ie CRUD without retrieve)\r\n\t\t\tthis involves having each subscriber have its own set of callbacks, which means each subscriber has its own subscriber/subscription object\r\n\r\n\t\tright now as it works\r\n\t\t\ta query can be a QuerySubscription or an EntitySubscription depending on if it is targeting a single entity\r\n\t\t\tboth trigger a get command to refresh their data when notified\r\n\t\t\tEntitySubscriptions (via normal subscriber) update themselves, QuerySubscriptions update their EntitySubscriptions (via QuerySubscription subscriber)\r\n\t\t\tall can have multiple subscribers so that events/lookup/etc. isn't repeated when the same query is subscribed to\r\n\r\n\t\tmaybe:\r\n\t\t\thave a query list\r\n\t\t\t\twhich contains queries that have a list of subscribers\r\n\t\t\t\tand a list of references to entities in the entity cache list\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis list can contain any amount of references\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t//! remember to not just do a direct reference, because if the entity is deleted from the cache, but still referenced in this list - it wont be removed, instead use a reactive getter\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis object also has a reactive getter that determines if it is for a single entity or not - though why would this be needed if the entire system is made the same? -
