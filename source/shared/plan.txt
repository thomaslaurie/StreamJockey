1. Refactor sj.request to not rely on the 'constructorName' property to rebuild objects.
	Instead just assume that the correct object is passed.
	There aren't too many instances of this so it shouldn't be hard.
2. Extract sj.rebuild, remove it entirely if possible.
	There also aren't too many instances, so it shouldn't be hard.
3. Continue extracting sj.Base
4. Extract sj.Success & sj.Error
	Remove them if possible.
5. Extract all other classes.
6. Start rewriting classes and getting rid of dependencies.
